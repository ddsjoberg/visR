The goal of visR is to enable fit-for-purpose, reusable clinical and
medical research focused visualizations and tables with sensible
defaults and based on sound graphical principles.

clinical development process, we want to have a **positive influence**
on

  - **choice of visualisation** by making it easy explore different
    visualisation and to use impactful visualisations fit-for-purpose
  - effective visual communication by making it easy to **implement best
    practices**

question, but want facilitate to make you do your work as you need it\!

You can read more about the philosophy and architecture in the repo
